PUBHUB Project

Please contact me for a video clip if somehow this project does not work. I works quite well on my lap. I keep the database name, password, url the same

To edit the book tag, click on its name in the ViewBookDetail page

I have done Add, Edit, Remove, Search Tag (move to the book page if clicked on one of the tags result and show all the tags if found more than 1)

For the search, if there is only 1 result, it will redirect to that book page. The session messages had change a little compare to the workingProof pictures
